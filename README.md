# Multi-Task Learning Pipeline for CAR Sequence-Based Signal Prediction

This project implements a multi-task deep learning workflow (**CAR-AI**) for classifying CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) sequences into functional synergy classes and predicting associated signal strengths. The system integrates sequence encoding, signal binning, class assignment, and a dual-head convolutional neural network for simultaneous classification and regression.

This Code Ocean capsule supports the manuscript:

"AI-Guided CAR Designs and AKT3 Degradation Synergize to Enhance Bispecific and Trispecific CAR T Cell Persistence and Overcome Antigen Escape"

It provides an end-to-end reproducible workflow to:
- Label CAR sequences with functional signal tiers
- Assign synergy classes (L-CARMSeD / M-CARMSeD / H-CARMSeD)
- Train a deep learning model for joint signal regression and class prediction
- Run inference on new, unseen CAR sequences

---

Pipeline Overview:

Step 1: signal-label.py
    - Assigns Signal-1/2/3 labels (low/middle/high)

Step 2: CAMSeD-label.py
    - Assigns CARMSeD class labels (L/M/H)

Step 3: train.py
    - Trains a multi-task CNN on labeled data

Step 4: Prediction-on-given-sequence.py
    - Predicts signal and class for new sequences

## üß™ Signal Labeling Logic

### Signal-1

| Value Range | Label   |
|-------------|---------|
| < 0.5       | low     |
| 0.5‚Äì1.0     | middle  |
| > 1.0       | high    |

### Signal-2 & Signal-3

| Value Range | Label   |
|-------------|---------|
| < 0.25      | low     |
| 0.25‚Äì0.5    | middle  |
| > 0.5       | high    |

## üè∑Ô∏è Class Label Assignment (CARMSeD: L/M/H)

Each sequence is assigned to a CARMSeD functional class based on the combination of its three signal labels:

- **L-CARMSeD**: Predominantly low or middle signals  
- **M-CARMSeD**: Mixed signals with moderate strength  
- **H-CARMSeD**: At least one high signal, or strong combinations  

Refer to `CARMSeD-label.py` for the complete rule-based mapping logic.

## Sequence Encoding

- Amino acid sequences are truncated or padded to 1024 residues  
- Each residue is integer-encoded using a fixed 20-letter vocabulary  
- Unknown residues are mapped to a placeholder token  

---

## Model Architecture

- **Input**: Integer-encoded sequences  
- **Embedding Layer**: Learnable (128 dimensions)  
- **Convolutional Layers**:  
  - Conv1D ‚Üí MaxPooling ‚Üí Conv1D ‚Üí GlobalMaxPooling  
- **Output 1**: 3-class softmax for CARMSeD classification  
- **Output 2**: Linear regression for Signal-1, Signal-2, and Signal-3

```python
loss = {
  'class_out': 'categorical_crossentropy',
  'signal_out': 'mse'
}
loss_weights = {'class_out': 3.0, 'signal_out': 1.0}
```

**Training settings**:  
- Stratified train/val split (80:20)  
- MinMaxScaler for signal normalization  
- Early stopping on validation accuracy

## Evaluation & Visualization

- Classification accuracy and confusion matrix  
- MSE and R¬≤ scores for signal regression  
- Measured vs. predicted signal scatter plots  
- Residual distributions and class-wise signal profiles  

**Key results**:
- **Accuracy**: ~96%  
- **R¬≤**: 0.87 (train), 0.83 (validation)  
- **RMSE**: < 0.1 ¬µg mL‚Åª¬π
